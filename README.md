# Team Project

## Description

The team project consists of two modules. Each module requires participants to apply the skills they have learned to date, and explore a dataset of their choosing. The first part of the team project involves creating a simple program with a database in order to analyze a dataset from an open source, such as Kaggle. In the second part of the team project, teams will come together again and apply the skills developed in each of the data science or machine learning foundations certificate streams. Teams will either create a data visualization or a machine learning model.

Participants will work in assigned teams of 4-5.

### Delivery of Team Project Modules

Each Team Project module will include two live learning sessions and one case study presentation. During live learning sessions, facilitators will introduce the project, walk through relevant examples, and introduce various team skills that support project success. The remaining time will be used for teams to assemble and work on their projects, as well as get help from the facilitator or the learning support to troubleshoot any issues a team may be encountering.

Work periods will also be used as opportunities for teams to collaborate and work together, while accessing learning support.

### Schedule

| Day 1                 | Day 2                 | Day 3      | Day 4       | Day 5       |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Live Learning Session | Live Learning Session | Case Study | Work Period | Work Period |

## Requirements

- Participants are expected to attend live learning sessions and the case study as part of the learning experience. Participants are encouraged to use the scheduled work period time to complete their projects.
- Participants are encouraged to ask questions and collaborate with others to enhance learning.
- Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
- Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate code to complete assignments. It should be used as a supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
- We expect participants to have completed the [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/tree/main/onboarding_documents).
- We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.

#### Approach
Each team member will experiment with different machine learning models on the sales transaction data to build a variety of models that can be used to address business questions such as: what customer segmentation exists, whether we can predict product ratings, which variables are the best explanatory variable to predict sales.

### Rules of Engagement
- Make decisions as a group on next steps in the evening working sessions
- Document our thought process and required tasks for task assignment in a shared work folder
- Notify team members of any difficulties with a task or meeting deadlines through Slack
- Daily touch points during/after lectures to discuss progress and adjust plans as needed to stay on schedule

## Team Project Week 2 - Machine Learning Model Guiding Questions

- Lynn: 

1. Objectives and Success Criteria:
The primary objective is to predict sales based on customer demographics.Success is measured by minimizing prediction errors (e.g., mean squared error) and accurately categorizing customers into segments that drive the most sales.

2. Feature Selection:
I used all of the categorical data that is provided  

3. Handling Missing Values and Outliers:
Ensured all missing values were handled through imputation techniques, and outliers were identified and either transformed or removed. Proper data cleaning ensured that the model could learn effectively without biases.

4. Algorithm:
Using a neural network model because of its ability to capture complex relationships between input and target variables. 

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Hyperparameter tuning method are used like Grid Search and by adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and layer configurations. Cross-validation was also used to ensure that the model generalized well.

4. Data Splitting:
The dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets, with 20% of the data reserved for testing. This split ensures that the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated on unseen data and helps prevent overfitting.

5. Ethical Considerations:
Considered the potential biases, especially those related to demographic features like income and city to ensure that the model does not unfairly favor or disadvantage specific groups.

6. Documentation:
The machine learning pipeline from data preprocessing to model tuning was documented in the model doc, including the rationale behind feature selection, the steps taken for data cleaning, and the architecture of the neural network.

- Jes:

1. Objectives and Success Criteria:
The primary objective is to understand the underlying sales data and produce a reliable client segmentation model that can be used to segment new clients. Model accuracy will be assessed through accuracy score of the testing data.

2. Feature Selection:
I used demographic (age, income, location), transaction amount and product category. There are columns that are highly correlated. In the future, I'd want to attempt dimension reductionality techniques such as PCA or regularization.

3. Handling Missing Values and Outliers:
Missing values and outliers were handled in the initial data load stages.

4. Algorithm:
Used KNN model for its simplicity to assess whether a simple model is able to have high prediction accuracy.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid search was used to identify the best model parameters for the KNN model.

4. Data Splitting:
The dataset was split into training (80%) and test sets (20%).


5. Ethical Considerations:
Since we are working with sensitive demographic data such as gender and income and account IDs, we need to ensure there is control in place in terms of who will be able to access the data and the model output.

- Carlos: 

1. Objectives: This project section explores predicting future product ratings from retail transaction data to enhance business decisions.

2. Business Applications: Potential uses include personalized recommendations, inventory management, targeted promotions, and loyalty program enhancements.

3. Modeling Approach: Multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, and Neural Networks, were tested in two runs. Detailed modelling steps and methodologt can be found in the Ratings Predictions Model notebook.

4. Data Handling: The first run used the full cleaned dataset, while the second used SMOTE to balance the training set and reduce skew from overrepresented ratings.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning: Limited manual tuning was performed due to computational constraints, and Grid Search was not fully implemented.

6. Model Performance: None of the models, including more sophisticated ones, surpassed 36% accuracy, but re-balancing improved true positive prediction rates across all rating classes.

7. Learning Outcome: The project consolidated learned concepts in Sacling to Production and Deep Learning modules and highlighted the importance of algorithm efficiency and data structure choices in the face of computational limitations.

8. Future Improvements: Suggestions include using more balanced datasets, comprehensive hyperparameter tuning, deeper neural networks, and input from subject matter experts.


9. Ethical Implications: Predicting product ratings could lead to biased recommendations if the model unintentionally amplifies existing biases in the data, potentially disadvantaging certain customer groups or promoting products unfairly
